# Speed Detection System 

A real-time vehicle speed monitoring system using Python and OpenCV.

Features
- Detects moving vehicles in video footage.
- Calculates vehicle speed using Euclidean distance.
- Records speed violations and saves data.
- Generates visual analytics using Matplotlib.
- Notifies violations (email/SMS logic can be extended).

Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- File Handling

How Speed is Calculated
1. The system tracks vehicle position frame-by-frame.
2. Computes distance between two frames.
3. Divides distance by time to get speed in px/s.

Output
- CSV or text log of vehicles and speeds
- Graphs showing speed violations

Future Improvements
- Integrate license plate recognition.
- Connect to database and deploy to cloud.
- Extend with notification APIs (Twilio, SMTP, etc.)
